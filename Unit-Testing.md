## Unit Testing for ReactJS

-   Specifically, unit tests work great for pure functions: Functions which given the same       input, always return the same output, and have no side-effects. One recent innovation in my testing discipline is the development of the RITEway unit testing framework, which is a tiny wrapper around Tape that helps you write simpler, more maintainable tests.

-   To get started, install RITEway:
-   $ npm install --save-dev riteway

## Unit Testing for Nodejs

-    I've never written a unit testing for my code I wrote, that means we'll actually be          writing tests against existing code. I'm going to use preexisting code that I've             already written, but the code that I'm writing is far less important than understanding      the lessons about writing unit tests for your code. But I know that Mocha and Chai are       the two testing frameworks for node. Mocha is the testing framework that's widely used       with Node and is the most popular one currently in use.
